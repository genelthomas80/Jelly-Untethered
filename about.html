      <p>
        Hi, I’m Genel. I’m <strong>[AGE]</strong>, based in <strong>[CITY, STATE]</strong>,
        and I’m single. Divorced single. Not mysterious, not dramatic. Just honest.
      </p>

      <p>
        For most of my adult life, I did what I was supposed to do. Built a career.
        Showed up. Stayed loyal. Played responsible human. It worked… until it didn’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        After years in the same career, unexpected changes, and a growing sense that my
        life was getting smaller instead of bigger, I hit a wall I couldn’t ignore.
        Burnout showed up. Restlessness followed. And the question “Is this really it?”
        refused to leave.

      <p>
        So instead of buying another couch or pretending a two-week vacation would fix
        everything, I made a bigger decision.

        Not to escape my life, but to reconnect with it. To see who I am when I’m not
        wrapped up in job titles, routines, or expectations that no longer fit.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site isn’t about perfect travel photos or pretending every day is magical.
        It’s about the real version of choosing yourself. The beautiful parts, the
        awkward parts, the lonely moments, and the surprising joy that shows up when
        you least expect it.
      </p>
