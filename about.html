    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Genel and my nickname is Jelly. I’m <strong>45 years old</strong>, and lived the majority of my life in Massachusetts.</strong>,
        I am single. Divorced single. Not it's complicated, single. Not, I have a FWB single. No mystery, not dramatic. Just honest. Honest to a fault some might say.
      </p>

      <p>
        For most of my adult life, I did what I was supposed to do. Went to college, earned a degree, paid off my loans, got married, built a career,
        bought a house, adopted many pets, earned a graduate degree and advanced certification in my field. I showed up. Stayed loyal. Played responsible human. 
        It worked… until it didn’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, the divorce, then unexpected changes at work and a growing sense that my
        life was getting smaller instead of bigger. I hit a wall I couldn’t ignore.
        Burnout showed up. Restlessness followed. And the question “Is this really it?”
        refused to leave. Life felt like a series of repeated actions, and I was a hamster on the wheel in my cage.
        Constantly running, but was I really going anywhere?
      </p>

      <p>
        So instead of buying another couch, pretending a vacation would fix
        everything, or picking up a drug habit, I made a bigger decision.
      </p>

      <p>
        I resigned from my job in January 2026 after twenty years of dedication and hard work.
        Twenty years in the same business, helping to grow it into the successful business it is now. 
        That business was my identity. I was proud of what I helped to create. While I don't regret a moment and am still
        proud. I see now that my career never should have been that much of my identity. There is more to life than just work.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had no idea what was next. I had no job and no income. So I did the most logical thing a girl could do, 
        I decided to take a vacation to regroup and figure out my next steps. I logged into my Holland America account
        to see if I had any offers for an inexpensive cruise. Low and behold, I had many. Before I knew it, my 
        one-week vacation plan was two weeks, then a month, then 3 month, etc. Before I knew it, I had a six-month
        itinerary planned out. I sat with this for a couple of days, looked at logistics and costs and compared to 
        current bills of rent, groceries, utilities, snow plowing service, etc and I found it would be less expensive to 
        live on a cruise ship than to maintain my apartment.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I made the decision to give notice to my landlord and travel the world over the next year.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Not to escape my life, but to reconnect with it. To see who I am when I’m not
        wrapped up in job titles, routines, or expectations that no longer fit.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site isn’t about perfect travel photos or pretending every day is magical.
        It’s about the real version of choosing yourself. The beautiful parts, the
        awkward parts, the lonely moments, and the surprising joy that shows up when
        you least expect it.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re here because you’re curious, restless, stuck, or quietly wondering if
        you’re allowed to want more, welcome. If youu are my friends and family, thanks for your constant support 
        supporting my crazy idea.
